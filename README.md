# YouCode SAS – C Programming Challenges

This repository contains my work on the C programming challenges from the YouCode SAS program.  
It is intended to track progress, practice problem-solving, and build a solid foundation in the C language.

---

## About
The challenges in this repository cover:
- Fundamentals of C programming
- Input/output operations
- Arrays and string handling
- Structures and pointers
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Small practical projects (e.g., banking system, contact manager)

---

## Challenges
Each folder corresponds to a specific challenge. Examples include:

- Challenge 01 – Variables and basic input/output  
- Challenge 02 – Arrays and initialization  
- Challenge 03 – Strings and character manipulation  
- Challenge 04 – Structures and pointers  
- Challenge 05 – Dynamic memory allocation  
- Challenge 06 – Banking system (continuous balance updates)  
- Challenge 07 – Contact management system  

Additional challenges will be added as the program progresses.
